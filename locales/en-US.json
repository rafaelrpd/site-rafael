    "about.description": "I am a developer focused on C# and .NET, passionate about building simple, secure, and maintainable solutions. I have experience creating APIs with ASP.NET Core, working with Entity Framework Core and Dapper, as well as modeling and integrating with databases like PostgreSQL and SQL Server. On a daily basis, I also use Docker for consistent environments and Git/Azure DevOps for versioning, Pull Requests, and pipelines.<br><br>I enjoy working on challenges involving system integration, data modeling, and continuous improvement of performance and reliability. I pay attention to architecture, code quality, and best practices, such as automated tests with xUnit and layered organization (Clean Architecture/DDD when it makes sense). I seek a balance between pragmatism and well-crafted engineering: delivering value without sacrificing standards that facilitate product evolution.",
